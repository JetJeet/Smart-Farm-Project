## Smart Farm Project README

1. Login and Sign-Up: Implement user authentication for secure access to the system.
2. Field Management: The farm’s field contains various sensors, actuators, and a weather station.
3. Sensors: Includes NPKSensor and MoistureSensor to monitor soil health and moisture levels.
4. Actuators: Controls sprinklers and motors for automated watering, based on sensor data.
5. Weather Station: Gathers environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity) to enhance farming decisions.
6. Controller: Manages water control logic by interacting with sensors (e.g., moisture levels) to trigger actuators.
7. Alert System: Notifies users of critical farm conditions, like low moisture levels or system failures.
8. User Interaction: Users can monitor farm conditions, control actuators, and receive alerts through the interface.
9. OOP Design: The project utilizes Java’s Object-Oriented Programming principles like inheritance, composition, and encapsulation.
10. Scalability: Easily extendable to support more sensors, actuators, and additional IoT devices for a smarter farm.
